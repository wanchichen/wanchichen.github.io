excerpt: "We present the University of Central Florida systems for the LoResMT 2021 Shared Task,
participating in the English-Irish and English-Marathi translation pairs. We focused our efforts
on constrained track of the task, using transfer learning and subword segmentation to enhance
our models given small amounts of training data. Our models achieved the highest BLEU
scores on the fully constrained tracks of English-Irish, Irish-English, and Marathi-English with
scores of 13.5, 21.3, and 17.9 respectively."

Abstract: We present the University of Central Florida systems for the LoResMT 2021 Shared Task,
participating in the English-Irish and English-Marathi translation pairs. We focused our efforts
on constrained track of the task, using transfer learning and subword segmentation to enhance
our models given small amounts of training data. Our models achieved the highest BLEU
scores on the fully constrained tracks of English-Irish, Irish-English, and Marathi-English with
scores of 13.5, 21.3, and 17.9 respectively.
