title: "Morphologically-Guided Segmentation For Translation of Agglutinative Low-Resource Languages"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/morpho-nmt
excerpt: 'Neural Machine Translation for Low Resource Languages is often limited by the lack of available training data, making it necessary to explore additional techniques to improve translation quality. We propose the use of the Prefix-Root-Postfix-Encoding (PRPE) subword segmentation algorithm to improve translation quality for LRLs, using two agglutinative languages as case studies: Quechua and Indonesian. We achieve state-of-the-art results for both languages, obtaining higher BLEU scores than large pre-trained models with much smaller amounts of data.'
