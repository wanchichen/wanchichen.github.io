title: "Morphologically-Guided Segmentation For Translation of Agglutinative Low-Resource Languages"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'Neural Machine Translation for Low Resource Languages s often limited by the lack of available training data, making it necessary to explore additional techniques to improve translation quality. We propose the use of the Prefix-Root-Postfix-Encoding (PRPE) subword segmentation algorithm to improve translation quality for LRLs, using two agglutinative languages as case studies: Quechua and Indonesian. We achieve state-of-the-art results for both languages, obtaining higher BLEU scores than large pre-trained models with much smaller amounts of data.'
