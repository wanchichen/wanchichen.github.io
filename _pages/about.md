I am currently a Software Engineer at Texas Instruments.

Since June 2020, I have been a member of the [UCF Computational Biology Lab](https://server.cs.ucf.edu/compbio/), headed by Professor [Wei Zhang](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~wzhang/). I work primarily under [Jiao Sun](https://server.cs.ucf.edu/compbio/people/).
Since January 2020, I have been a member of the [UCF Evolutionary Computation Lab](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~ecl/index.html), headed by Professor [Annie Wu](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~aswu/).

## Selected Projects

[uBump.co](https://shop.ubump.co) August 2020 - April 2021

<img src="../images/bump.png">

I worked with [Brennen Fountain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennen-fountain-743302149/) and [Brett Fazio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-fazio/) to create uBump, an NFC oriented social media sharing site.

Users can simply tap their NFC stickers against a smartphone and instantly share all of their socials. Sample uBump Profile available [here](https://ubump.co/william).

uBump was sold to [Bolstered Equity Group](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/bolstered-equity-group-acquires-ubump--a3029e9a) in April 2021.

[valorantify.com](https://github.com/wanchichen/valorantify-preview) June 2020 - August 2020

<img src="../images/valorantify.PNG">

I helped develop one of the first VALORANT e-sports sites, which quickly became one of the top statistics and news sources for the budding professional scene. We were eventually acquired by [thespike.gg](https://www.thespike.gg/).

[Finch - Personal Finance Projections App](https://github.com/ucfinancegroup/pfp)

<img src="../images/finch.png">

For our Senior Design Project, [Charles Bailey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-bailey/), [Heath Milligan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heath-milligan/), [Brett Fazio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-fazio/), [Andy Phan](), and I created a personal finance application geared towards complex financial projections. Built with Rust, React.ts, SwiftUI, and MongoDB, our application Finch was able to use financial data linked via Plaid to automatically track user financial metrics such as spending and income.

Our custom projection engine allowed users to specify asset allocation amounts and simulate common financial events. Our system is also able to aggregate users together based off of similar financial situations, allowing for the recommendation of products used by similar users. We offer the user transparancy with our aggregation, allowing users to see their financial performance relative to peers through our leaderboards component.
