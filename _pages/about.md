I am a Master's in Language Technologies student at Carnegie Mellon University's LTI. I am advised by Professor [Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe), as a part of the [Audio and Voice Lab](https://shinjiwlab.github.io). 
My work at CMU has focused on building large-scale speech foundation models. My other research interests are in multilingual speech recognition and speech translation.

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Texas Instruments, as part of the [Ti.com](https://ti.com) e-commerce team. [This](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-automates-purchasing-experience-130000831.html) [collection](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/texas-instruments_texas-instruments-automates-the-purchasing-ugcPost-6993202576871632896-29MT/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios) [of articles](https://news.ti.com/texas-instruments-automates-purchasing-experience-with-ti-store-apis?HQS=ocb-tistore-promo-api_launch-linked-pr-null-wwe_awr) details some of the work I did on the team.

I received my BS in Computer Science and BA in History from the University of Central Florida in May 2021.

## Past Positions

From May 2023 to August 2023, I was a Research Intern at the [NTT Communication Sciences Lab](https://www.rd.ntt/e/cs/) in Japan, supervised by [Marc Delcroix](https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/signal/member/marcd/), [Atsunori Ogawa](https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/signal/member/ogawa/), and [Takatomo Kano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qGzzrJYAAAAJ&hl=en).

From April 2021 to July 2021, I was part of the [UCF Security and Analytics Lab](http://seal.cs.ucf.edu), supervised by Professor [David Mohaisen](http://cs.ucf.edu/~mohaisen/).

From June 2020 to July 2022, I was a Research Assistant at the [UCF Computational Biology Lab](https://server.cs.ucf.edu/compbio/), supervised by Professor [Wei Zhang](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~wzhang/).

From January 2020 to October 2021, I was part of the [UCF Evolutionary Computation Lab](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~ecl/index.html), supervised by Professor [Annie Wu](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~aswu/).
