I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute, advised by Professor [Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe), as a part of the [Audio and Voice Lab](https://shinjiwlab.github.io).
My work at CMU has focused on building large-scale speech foundation models. I am interested in methods that can make speech models more generally useful and rely less on human supervision/effort or modelling assumptions.
This includes topics like self-supervised speech representation learning, multilingual speech processing, and long-form speech processing.
 
Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Texas Instruments, as part of the [Ti.com](https://ti.com) e-commerce team.

I received my Master's in Language Technologies from CMU LTI in May 2024, and my BS in Computer Science and BA in History from the University of Central Florida in May 2021.
