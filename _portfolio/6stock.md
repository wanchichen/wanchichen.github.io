I created a silly program that "predicts" stock prices, inspired by [Dr. Parik Patel](https://twitter.com/parikpatelcfa/status/1334497433469022208). It uses Otsu thresholding to obtain a city skyline from a source image, which is then mapped to a stock specified by the user. Implemented using React and Django.
