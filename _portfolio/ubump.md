I worked with [Brennen Fountain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennen-fountain-743302149/) and [Brett Fazio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-fazio/) to create [uBump](https://shop.ubump.co), an NFC oriented social media sharing site.

Users can simply tap their NFC stickers against a smartphone and instantly share all of their socials. Sample uBump Profile available [here](https://ubump.co/william).

uBump was sold to [Bolstered Equity Group](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/bolstered-equity-group-acquires-ubump--a3029e9a) in April 2021.
