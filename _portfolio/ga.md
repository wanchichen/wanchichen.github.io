I created a genetic algorithm model for semantic-based extractive summarization for my graduate level Evolutionary Computation course.

Previous works rely on sentence-based extraction, accomplished via heuristics such as sentence length and positioning. I wanted to create a model that relied purely upon word semantics, making the model more generalizable across formats and domains.
