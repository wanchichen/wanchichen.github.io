For our Senior Design Project, [Charles Bailey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-bailey/), [Heath Milligan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heath-milligan/), [Brett Fazio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-fazio/), [Andy Phan](), and I created a personal finance application geared towards complex financial projections. Built with Rust, React.ts, SwiftUI, and MongoDB, our application Finch was able to use financial data linked via Plaid to automatically track user financial metrics such as spending and income.

Our custom projection engine allowed users to specify asset allocation amounts and simulate common financial events. Our system is also able to aggregate users together based off of similar financial situations, allowing for the recommendation of products used by similar users. We offer the user transparancy with our aggregation, allowing users to see their financial performance relative to peers through our leaderboards component.
