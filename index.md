I will be returning to Texas Instruments as a Software Engineer in July 2021. 

From June 2020 to August 2020, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Texas Instruments in the ERP Operations Team.

I helped develop one of the first VALORANT e-sports sites, which quickly became one of the top statistics and news sources for the budding professional scene. We were eventually acquired by [thespike.gg](https://www.thespike.gg/).
